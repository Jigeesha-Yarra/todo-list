# User Management Web Application

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details. It interacts with the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) API to simulate backend operations such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting users. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Add User:** Allows you to add a new user by filling out a form.
- **Edit User:** Allows you to edit an existing user's details by populating the form with the current data and updating it.
- **Delete User:** Enables deletion of a user from the list.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling of the web page, including responsive design and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handling all logic related to CRUD operations with the backend API.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: A free mock REST API for testing and demonstration.
